	<h3>how to get this to run locally</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/Joram3000/my-cineville-app">Link to github project</a>
	<p>npm install or pnpm install</p>
	<p>npm run dev or pnpm run dev</p>

	<h3>Approach</h3>
	<p>
		I started by creating a small step-by-step plan: initialize the project, set up the routes and
		that kind of stuff, and then work incrementally from there. If something started taking too
		long, I moved on to ensure that as much functionality as possible was implemented within the
		available time. I deliberately tried to limit the use of AI. While it is of course something we
		commonly use nowadays—for example for syntax-related assistance—I wanted the work to primarily
		reflect my own approach and decisions. Fetching the data took longer than expected; otherwise, I
		would have spent more time on the UI. Under a strict time limit, there are multiple valid
		approaches. My approach in this case was to extract as much functionality as possible from the
		time available—prioritizing functionality over UI—while leaving comments indicating what should
		be addressed next. The next step I would focus on is implementing the movie search
		functionality, along with the remaining attributes required by the assignment. After that, I
		would do a proper cleanup and refactor the code into clearer, reusable components (such as a
		movie/event card).
